1,Another Study of Woman,"A series of tales -- told by men, of course -- about women. Though the book first appeared in 1842, Balzac later added to it as an addenfum a tale of 1831, La Grande Bretèche. That will be read later, keeping it separate to mirror the form of the English translation here used.",5918,https://www.archive.org/download/another_study_woman_1609_librivox/anotherstudywoman_01_balzac_64kb.mp3,https://archive.org/download/another_study_woman_1609_librivox/another_study_woman_1609.jpg,499,9782322457755,2023-01-28 23:34:50,Fiction
10,The Thirty-nine Steps,"Richard Hannay’s boredom is soon relieved when the resourceful engineer is caught up in a web of secret codes, spies, and murder on the eve of WWI. This exciting action-adventure story was the inspiration for Alfred Hitchcock’s 1939 classic film of the same name. John Buchan (1875-1940) was Governor General of Canada and a popular novelist. Although condemned by some for anti-Semitic dialog in The Thirty-Nine Steps, his character’s sentiments do not represent the view of the author who was identified in Hitler’s Sonderfahndungsliste (special search list) as a ""Jewish sympathiser.""",15642,https://www.archive.org/download/39_steps_0807_librivox/thirtyninesteps_01_buchan_64kb.mp3,https://www.archive.org/download/LibrivoxCdCoverArt/Thirty_Nine_Steps_1003.jpg,2599,9788771743067,2023-01-29 00:27:05,Adventure
11,Adaptation,"In 1960 when this was published, the Cold War was at its height. Communism and Free Enterprise (Democracy) were locked in a ferocious struggle to prove that their political ideology was the best form of government for human kind. No holds were barred in this fight; propaganda was poured forth by both sides in a constant push to be seen as better, more progressive, more productive. Nuclear war was a constant threat. I know, I lived through that time. Thankfully the world came through that stressful time without a hot war but the question was not really settled: which is the better system? This story explores that question. ""Hardly had man solved his basic problems on the planet of his origin than he began to fumble into space. Barely a century had elapsed in the exploration of the Solar System than he began to grope for the stars. And suddenly, with an all but religious zeal, mankind conceived its fantasy dream of populating the galaxy.""",10510,https://www.archive.org/download/adaptation_2106_librivox/adaptation_01_reynolds_64kb.mp3,https://archive.org/download/adaptation_2106_librivox/adaption_2106.jpg,1289,9780197511176,2023-01-29 00:34:06,Fiction
12,Omar Resung,"Most of the translations of the Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyam have been in verse. However, there have been three notable exceptions to this convention; the French translation by J. B. Nicolas (1867), the English version by Justin Huntly McCarthy (1889) and another English version by Frederick Rolfe (better known as Baron Corvo, the author of Hadrian VII), published in 1903.

Charles Blanden (1857 - 1933) belonged to the group known as the Chicago poets, the most famous of which was Carl Sandburg. Unlike his celebrated contemporary. Blanden was no innovator, and most of his verse is sweet and melodious, composed with craftsmanlike skill, but often lacking in imaginative fervour. Most of his collections of verse, bearing such titles as The Battle of Love, A Chorus of Leaves, A Drift of Song, and A Valley Muse, were published in limited editions, which have not since been reprinted, and today his poetry is considered of little more than historical interest.",9151,https://www.archive.org/download/omar_resung_1205_librivox/omarresung_1_blanden_64kb.mp3,https://archive.org/download/LibrivoxCdCoverArt23/Omar_Resung_1210.jpg,699,9798350025903,2023-01-29 13:06:45,Poetry
13,Studies of Death,"Count Stanislaus Eric Stenbock was an eccentric character to say the least. Maintaining a veritable zoo on his estate populated with the likes of a reindeer and a bear, he travelled with a dog, a monkey and a life-sized doll he nicknamed ""The Little Count"" and which he referred to as ""his son"". Before his untimely death at the age of 36 of cirrhosis of the liver due to his excessive alcoholism and opium addiction, Stenbock managed to publish three slim volumes of poetry, much of which was fixated on suicide, as well as this volume of short stories, Studies of Death. This short collection of tales of death in all its various forms featuring occultism, vampires, jilted lovers and sea sprites among other things is seen as not only an early curiosity of occult and weird literature but also contains early queer themes as well, most notably in the stories ""Hylas"" and ""The True Story of a Vampire"". While one would expect much of a collection titled Studies in Death to fixate on the grim side of human nature, we do see a few peeks at death of a more hopeful nature as well, in addition to the bleak and tragic.",7002,https://www.archive.org/download/studies_of_death_2301_librivox/studiesofdeath_01_stenbock_64kb.mp3,https://archive.org/download/studies_of_death_2301_librivox/studies_death_2301.jpg,889,9781943813759,2023-01-29 13:13:25,Horror

16,Amphibians and Reptiles in Captivity,"In recent years the number of people interested in keeping amphibians and reptiles in captivity has grown rapidly. All too often, these same people have little knowledge of the proper care needed for their captives, nor do they know where to turn in order to learn the needs of their animals. It is the intent of the authors of this special issue to offer the proper information needed to successfully keep amphibians and reptiles in captivity. We are by no means THE experts on the subject, nor do we claim to cover all the facts. However, we do hope that enough information is furnished to answer most of the common questions asked by people.",3294,https://www.archive.org/download/amphibians_1910_librivox/amphibians_01_coxwell_64kb.mp3,https://archive.org/download/amphibians_1910_librivox/amphibians_1019.jpg,429,9780713723380,2023-01-29 13:35:49,Science

18,The World of Sound,"The World of Sound consists of six lectures delivered before a juvenile audience at the Royal Institution, Christmas 1919. The Royal Institution Christmas Lectures are a series of lectures on a single topic, which have been held at the Royal Institution in London each year since 1825, except several years during the Second World War. The lectures present scientific subjects to a general audience, including young people, in an informative and entertaining manner. Michael Faraday initiated the first Christmas Lecture series in 1825, at a time when organised education for young people was scarce.

This series of lectures is still interesting for its basic explanation of sound and hearing, and the history of the research into it. The last chapter, Sound in War, was of course written at a time when submarines - and aeroplanes - were in their infancy. Acoustic mirrors, used as early warning devices of approaching aircraft before the invention of radar, are described, but the reader suspects that at the time of writing, the new invention of ASDIC (the predecessor of Sonar) was still secret and so was not mentioned in this lecture.",16431,https://www.archive.org/download/worldofsound_rg_1512_librivox/worldofsound_01_bragg_64kb.mp3,https://archive.org/download/librivoxcCDCoverArt35/worldofsound_1601.jpg,1489,9780844617220,2023-01-29 18:45:20,Science
19,The Kama Sutra,"The Kama Sutra, or Aphorisms on Love, has survived at least 1400 years as a dominant text on sexual relations between men and women. Vatsyayana claimed to have written the Kama Sutra while a religious student, “in contemplation of the Deity” - but references to older works, shrewd disputations by Vatsyayana of those authors' recommendations, and careful cataloging of practices in various of the Indian states indicate much more emphasis on kama, or sensual gratification.

Part of the book discusses the 64 arts of love employed by masters of coitus. Learning each of these and when and how to practice them, Vatsyayana affirms, not only leads to the best gratification, but makes the artist a person of great desirability.

Once the means of sexual congress are discussed, the many types of male-female relationships and their proper prosecution are covered. Some of these have small relevance to the modern world, such as how to sneak into the King's harem, but are interesting nonetheless. Others, such as how to get money from a lover, will probably remain useful as long as there are humans in the world. 

The translator's concluding remarks call the book primitive; so might also modern women who are told that if their name ends in “l” or “r” they should not be married, because they are worthless. But in tackling the subject of human sexuality, Vatsyayana nevertheless will always attract readers (or, in this case, listeners!).",22558,https://www.archive.org/download/kama_sutra_1008_librivox/kamasutra_01_vatsyayana_64kb.mp3,https://archive.org/download/LibrivoxCdCoverArt21/KamaSutra_1208.jpg,6969,9783868200355,2023-01-29 19:02:20,Erotica
2,No Thoroughfare,"Two boys from the Foundling Hospital are given the same name, with disastrous consequences in adulthood. Two associates, wishing to right the wrong, are commissioned to find a missing heir. Their quest takes them from fungous wine cellars in the City of London to the sunshine of the Mediterranean—across the Alps in winter. Danger and treachery would prevail were it not for the courage of the heroine and the faithful company servant. 

The story contains crafted descriptions, well-drawn and diverse characters, eerie and exotic backgrounds, mystery, semi-concealed identities, brinkmanship with death, romance, the eventual triumph of Good over Evil, and many other elements expected in classic Dickens. 

First published in 1867 there are thematic parallels with other books from Dickens' mature writings, including Little Dorrit (1857) and especially Our Mutual Friend (1865). The Listener will decide if this story yields insights into The Mystery of Edwin Drood (unfinished 1870). 

Wilkie Collins collaborated with Charles Dickens to produce this ‘Christmas’ book and the stage play of the same name. In the book Collins assisted in Act 1 and Act 4; Collins scripted most of the stage play with Dickens’ assistance. If this book were released today it would be splashed ""THE BOOK OF THE FILM""",21389,https://www.archive.org/download/no_thoroughfare_librivox/nothoroughfare_act0_scene1_dickens_64kb.mp3,https://www.archive.org/download/LibrivoxCdCoverArt10/No_Thoroughfare_1108.jpg,1449,9780958224901,2023-01-28 23:42:24,Fiction
20,The Awakening,"Owing to its highly personal content focused on feminine sexuality, this LibriVox edition was recorded by eight female readers. 

The Modern Library edition of The Awakening has an introduction by Kay Gibbons, who writes: “The Awakening shocked turn-of-the-century readers with its forthright treatment of sex and suicide. Departing from literary convention, Kate Chopin failed to condemn her heroine’s desire for an affair with the son of a Louisiana resort owner, whom she meets on vacation. The power of sensuality, the delusion of ecstatic love, and the solitude that accompanies the trappings of middle- and upper-class life are the themes of this now-classic novel.” – As Kay Gibbons points out, Chopin “was writing American realism before most Americans could bear to hear that they were living it.”

To give you an idea of the subject matter, Project Gutenburg catalogues The Awakening under ""Adultery -- Fiction -- Women -- Louisiana -- New Orleans -- Social conditions.",18881,https://www.archive.org/download/awakening_librivox/awakening_01_chopin_64kb.mp3,https://archive.org/download/awakening_librivox/awakening_1006.jpg,969,9780786176434,2023-01-29 19:13:48,Erotica
21,American Cookery,"American Cookery, by Amelia Simmons, was the first known cookbook written by an American, published in 1796. Until this time, the cookbooks printed and used in what became the United States were British cookbooks, so the importance of this book is obvious to American culinary history, and more generally, to the history of America. The full title of this book was: American Cookery, or the art of dressing viands, fish, poultry, and vegetables, and the best modes of making pastes, puffs, pies, tarts, puddings, custards, and preserves, and all kinds of cakes, from the imperial plum to plain cake: Adapted to this country, and all grades of life.",5834,https://www.archive.org/download/american_cookery_1105_librivox/americancookery_1_simmons_64kb.mp3,https://archive.org/download/american_cookery_1105_librivox/american_cookery_1212.jpg,589,9780915591008,2023-01-29 19:23:54,Cooking

7,The Genealogy of Morals,"In 1887, with the view of amplifying and completing certain new doctrines which he had merely sketched in Beyond Good and Evil (see especially Aphorism 260), Nietzsche published The Genealogy of Morals. This work is perhaps the least aphoristic, in form, of all Nietzsche's productions. For analytical power, more especially in those parts where Nietzsche examines the ascetic ideal, The Genealogy of Morals is unequalled by any other of his works; and, in the light which it throws upon the attitude of the ecclesiast to the man of resentment and misfortune, it is one of the most valuable contributions to sacerdotal psychology.",20683,https://www.archive.org/download/genealogy_of_morals_1507_librivox/genealogyofmorals_00_nietzsche_64kb.mp3,https://archive.org/download/genealogy_of_morals_1507_librivox/genealogyofmorals_1507.jpg,2589,0199537089,2023-01-28 23:15:03,Modern
